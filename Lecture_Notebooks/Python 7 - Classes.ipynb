    "\n",
    "Python supports programming in a **object-oriented** style. So far we've seen **procedural programming** where we divide up tasks into individual functions, and each function operates on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In procedural programming, **functions** are the building blocks of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), **objects** are the building blocks of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "An object packages both **data** and **functionality** (or **behaviour**). Usually, objects correspond to real-world concepts. For example, a `Rectangle` object might contain `width` and `height` **data** attributes, and provide `area()` and `perimeter()` **functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a \"blueprint\" for creating an object. In the following code, we first create a `Rectangle` class and then use this blueprint to create an actual object, called `rect`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of thinking of classes is that they allow you to create your own types; in principle you could create your own `String`, `List` and `Dict` classes that provide all the functionality of the built-in types."
